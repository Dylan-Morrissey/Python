# My Python Examples.
Here is a more detailed description about the python scritps I have written. I created these scripts to help myself understand and learn python. I would happily accept pointers from others to help me improve my code and make it more efficent ot easier to read. 

* [irishReg.py](https://github.com/Dylan-Morrissey/Python/blob/master/irishReg.py) - I created this script to help me understand and learn dictionaries. It is uses dictionaries to store the city identifier for car registrations in Ireland. You can search the city identifier if you are not sure and you can also play a quiz to try and guess the city identifiers.

* [markov.py](https://github.com/Dylan-Morrissey/Python/blob/master/markov.py) - A python script using Markov chain to predict the probability of moving to another access point.

* [largestNum.py](https://github.com/Dylan-Morrissey/Python/blob/master/largestNum.py) - Simple script which gets the largest number from a list.

* [passwordGenerator.py](https://github.com/Dylan-Morrissey/Python/blob/master/passwordGenerator.py) - I created this script to help me generate secure passwords for my accounts due to recent data breaches.

* [timetomins.py](https://github.com/Dylan-Morrissey/Python/blob/master/timetomins.py) - I created this script to help me with a project and I was also intrested to see what percent of work I completed at a given time was.

* [learnPythonHardWay](https://github.com/Dylan-Morrissey/Python/tree/master/learnPythonHardWay) - Is a series of short python script which I created to help me understand python from simply printing to the console to Object oriented classes.
